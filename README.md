# Elevator-Project
Elevator Simulation Project

This repository contains an elevator simulation project created by me as a solo school project. The project is built in Python using the Pygame module and aims to simulate the functioning of an elevator system.

Motivation:
The purpose of this project was to develop a simple yet interactive elevator simulation, providing a practical understanding of programming concepts and enhancing my skills in Python and game development using Pygame. By undertaking this project, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in implementing a real-world scenario and solving complex problems.

Features:

Elevator System: The project simulates a multi-floor building with an elevator system that can move between floors.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The graphical interface is built using Pygame, providing a visual representation of the elevator and its movements.
User Interactions: Users can interact with the elevator system by pressing the floor buttons to request a ride and observe the elevator's movements.
Realistic Behavior: The elevator follows realistic behaviors, such as moving between floors, opening and closing doors, and responding to user requests.
Floor Queue: The elevator system maintains a queue of floor requests, ensuring efficient operation based on user inputs.
Development Details:

Language: Python
Library: Pygame
Development Time: Two weeks
Total Hours: Approximately 20 hours
Getting Started:
To run the elevator simulation on your local machine, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. Clone this repository and execute the main Python file. The graphical interface will open, allowing you to interact with the elevator system.

Contributions:
As this project was created for educational purposes and completed individually, contributions from other developers are not expected at this time. However, you are welcome to explore, learn from, and build upon the existing codebase as per the guidelines mentioned in the repository.

Disclaimer:
This project serves as a learning exercise and may not represent an actual production-grade elevator system. It should be used solely for educational purposes and not for real-world applications.

I hope this repository provides an insightful demonstration of my skills and efforts in creating an elevator simulation using Python and Pygame. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the simulation, and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
